I am a Coding dojo student in my first stack. I play football and basketball on my spare time. My longterm goal is to finish coding school
and get a job I love that pays well enough to support myself and my hobbies. I enjoy taking on new tasks and challenges and don't give it 
up until I've achieved what I set out to do.
